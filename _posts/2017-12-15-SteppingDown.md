category: Announcement StrPlatinum
excerpt: StrPlatinum has stepped down as Chancellor!
---

Eddie, also known as StrPlatinum in-game has officially announced that he will step down as Chancellor, and will relinquish his executive powers once the new Chancellor has been elected. His decision comes from his own opinion that although he has served faithfully for a month and a half, he can no longer adequately fulfil the role and that somebody more equipped to handle internal and internation affairs should take the reins. The election to find his replacement will be held on the 19th of December. 

If you are planning to run as a candidate, you must fulfil both of the following requirements:-

1. You must be a citizen of Southshire, although citizenship of the Commonwealth is also acceptable.

2. You must be, or have been a Councilor for Southshire, *or* have recognised leadership ability*.

[1] Recognised leadership ability is determined by a super majority of the legislature and judicial 
branch collectively (Article 8, Constitution) And so you would need a vote in favor from four of 
following: Baes20, Callum, Cinzar, Orinnari, Specificlanguage
