Lord Mayor Orinnari has officially announced that he will be moving Oakhurst to a different location within the Commonwealth. Oakhurst, his one-man borough was situated just south east of the capital of Southshire, and has existed since the controversial trial of MrMamizoupie. It was however converted into a borough by the Lord Mayor after his loss to Callum in the election to become councilor. He made the following petition to the council in #citizens:

> Okay, I'd like to announce that Oakhurst has officially been cleared of all structures, and that the surface has been repaired. As such, I, as the Lord Mayor of Oakhurst, its single owner, government, and inhabitant, am officially offering the enclave via petition to the council. If approved, the land will be ceded to Southshire, and Oakhurst will cease to exist within the context and bounds of Southend.

The Council, which currently consists of StrPlatinum and Callum, approved the petition, with StrPlatinum stating:

> The council has decided to annex the old oakhurst lands
