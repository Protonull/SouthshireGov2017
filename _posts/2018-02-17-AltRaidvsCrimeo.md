The pearling of Crimeo by AltRaid, which happened before [the fracas between AltRaid and Capri,]({% post_url 2018-02-13-AltRaidvsCapri %}) 
caused an almost immediate ban by StrPlatinum via [Casual Powers.](/pdf#government/parliament/ParliamentaryPowers) 
However, after an official statement was released by Orinnari, [which you can read here.](/pdf#archive/AltRaidvsCrimeo), 
Parliament voted unanimously to sentence AltRaid to three hours community service, and that 
until he completes it, is banned from entering Southshire, although may still use our rail network.
