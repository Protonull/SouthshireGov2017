## Our path

If we were going to transition to Yoahtl we wanted to do it properly, and so we devised 
three steps to complete before pushing the button and making the change.

1. ***Receive and invitation from Yoahtl via their own processes.*** We did not want to 
first secede from the Commonwealth and then find ourselves in the position of having to 
wait or possibly being denied, which would cut ourselves off from all federal protection 
and infrastructure.

2. ***Negotiate with the Commonwealth to discuss permission and concerns.*** We wanted 
to make sure that our plans were acceptable to the Commonwealth as to not create an 
international incident, our primary concern being land.

3. ***Conduct a vote within our local government.*** We wanted to make sure that we did 
actually want to go through with this, and so the entire government - the council and 
deputies - were required to vote, and only if the vote was unanimous would we make the 
transition.

All three conditions were met, and so we made the transition.
