order to join Yoahtl as an autonomous town as described in &lt;a href=&quot;/pdf#government/yoahtl/AscensionOfSouthshire&quot;&gt;this document.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-path&quot;&gt;Our path&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were going to transition to Yoahtl we wanted to do it properly, and so we devised 
three steps to complete before pushing the button and making the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Receive and invitation from Yoahtl via their own processes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We did not want to 
first secede from the Commonwealth and then find ourselves in the position of having to 
wait or possibly being denied, which would cut ourselves off from all federal protection 
and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Negotiate with the Commonwealth to discuss permission and concerns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We wanted 
to make sure that our plans were acceptable to the Commonwealth as to not create an 
international incident, our primary concern being land.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conduct a vote within our local government.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We wanted to make sure that we did 
actually want to go through with this, and so the entire government - the council and 
deputies - were required to vote, and only if the vote was unanimous would we make the 
transition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three conditions were met, and so we made the transition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Announcement Secession" /><summary type="html">Southshire has seceded from the Commonwealth and has become an autonomous town of Yoathl.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Constitution Dissolved!</title><link href="https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2018-01-14/ConstitutionDissolved" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Constitution Dissolved!" /><published>2018-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2018-01-14/ConstitutionDissolved</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2018-01-14/ConstitutionDissolved">&lt;p&gt;Parliament has voted unanimously to dissolve the Constitution, so that it no longer holds

Because of this, we no longer feel that a six person government is justified (a chancellor, three councillors, and two judges) And so we have decided to devolve the government to a smaller form, which will function similarly to what we have now, but be more like the system we had before the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the previous reform, we created a more American system where the government was separated into three distinct branches, the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. With this reform however we shall be going back to the roots of the Commonwealth theme with a Parliament, and so the Councillors will become Ministers, and the Chancellor, Prime Minister. Judgeship will be an additional responsibility, likely to be carried out as a Deputy of the Department for Justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parliament will continue to have three seats, and cinzar and I will transfer to fill two of those, and the last one will be up for election. Cinzar will also assume the role of Prime Minister due to his recent election as Chancellor. Specificlanguage and I will continue to be part of the judiciary. It should not be uncommon for officials to have more than one role within the government, because we can no longer afford to be so narrow in our processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the election for our third minister will occur this coming Monday, 1st January 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Announcement Reform" /><summary type="html">Southshire is returning to a Council-only system.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Chancellor elected!</title><link href="https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-12-19/ChancellorElected" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chancellor elected!" /><published>2017-12-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-12-19/ChancellorElected</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-12-19/ChancellorElected">&lt;p&gt;Cinzar has been elected as the new Chancellor.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Announcement Election Cinzar" /><summary type="html">Cinzar has been elected as the new Chancellor.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Snowshire renamed!</title><link href="https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-12-17/Barrow" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Snowshire renamed!" /><published>2017-12-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-12-17/Barrow</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-12-17/Barrow">&lt;p&gt;Snowshire was regularly misheard as Southshire, and so it has been renamed to Barrow to reduce confusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Announcement StrPlatinum" /><summary type="html">Snowshire has been renamed to Barrow.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Chancellor to step down</title><link href="https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-12-15/SteppingDown" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chancellor to step down" /><published>2017-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-12-15/SteppingDown</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-12-15/SteppingDown">&lt;p&gt;Eddie, also known as StrPlatinum in-game has officially announced that he will step down as Chancellor, and will relinquish his executive powers once the new Chancellor has been elected. His decision comes from his own opinion that although he has served faithfully for a month and a half, he can no longer adequately fulfil the role and that somebody more equipped to handle internal and internation affairs should take the reins. The election to find his replacement will be held on the 19th of December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are planning to run as a candidate, you must fulfil both of the following requirements:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must be a citizen of Southshire, although citizenship of the Commonwealth is also acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must be, or have been a Councilor for Southshire, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; have recognised leadership ability*.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Recognised leadership ability is determined by a super majority of the legislature and judicial 
branch collectively (Article 8, Constitution) And so you would need a vote in favor from four of 
following: Baes20, Callum, Cinzar, Orinnari, Specificlanguage&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Announcement StrPlatinum" /><summary type="html">StrPlatinum has stepped down as Chancellor!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Constitution of Southshire</title><link href="https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-10-01/Constitution" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Constitution of Southshire" /><published>2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-10-01/Constitution</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://southshiregov2017.protonull.uk/pages/Protonull/SouthshireGov2017/2017-10-01/Constitution">&lt;p&gt;The surging population ever increasing the need for defined legal codes and processes has lead Charlameme and Orinnari to spend the majority of their time over the past few days discussing and debating on what should and should most certaintly not be included in this new Constitution, as while it does carry over many of the amendments from its predecessor, it was written in the early days of Southshire by Orinnari and therefore did not include anything about justice or pearling. The Council were kept abreast of each change they made and how it would impact Southshire, and is now being published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/pdf#archive/Constitution2&quot;&gt;Read the Constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, the Council will remain but will largely deal with laws, their implementation, and their enforcement, while newly created entities will handle justice and executive power. Eddie (StrPlatinum) will move laterally into the executive position of Chancellor, opening up his seat for another. It also enforces a monthly refresh of the Council as well as expanding on Citizen’s rights, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Announcement Constitution Charlameme Orinnari" /><summary type="html">The new Constitution written by Charlameme and Orinnari has been published and ratified!</summary></entry></feed>
